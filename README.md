# Jeremy Trimble's Website

## Purpose
To serve as my home space on the web.

## Status 
I'm currently planning on changing the website up to be split into two main parts. One for displaying my professional experience and interests. The other will be very similar in layout, but the content will be a little more personal in nature. I suspect it will evolve from what I currently envision. I am planning on continuing to use Gatsby however because it provides a little magic that I don't have to worry about while still using React.
