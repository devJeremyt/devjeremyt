Life can be hard sometimes, the important thing is to keep moving forward. If you stand still you go nowhere, but taking just one step gets your further than you were. Time is precious for everyone, but many people don’t think about the minutes or hours they squander. Just watching 2 hours a day of TV results in a little over 30 days a year. Does watching TV for a month every year seem worthwhile? Do you want 1/12th of your life to be spent on consuming whatever the TV has to show you. I’m not saying don’t watch TV, but maybe review where your hours are spent. My days are segmented, at least weekdays, in a prescriptive manner.

### Work 8AM-5PM

Assuming work is the start of the day, my day begins at 8AM. I’ve worked for two companies in my 14 years of employment, and aside from coming in early during special needs and the year I started my day at 6 AM as a welding manager, I’ve always started work at 8 AM. I would prefer earlier to be honest, I’ll write another blog about my desired life schedule. Work is a typical 8-5 with an hour for lunch, and lunch may be an hour at any point throughout the day. That hour is typically for personal use, I don’t eat lunch a lot of the time. Occasionally I don’t take that hour if the work required for the day can’t be done in 8 hours.

### Family 5PM-9PM

Work ends at 5, or at least around 5. Somedays it’s 5:15 or later, just depending on the last task of the day. Assuming I’m working from home, family time starts right at 5 and lasts till 9. These are my favorite 4 hours of the day, occasionally I’ll be working not at home and commute time interferes with this time. This is when I spend time with my family, eating dinner, playing games with the girls, or conversing with my in-laws. The way this time is spent differs with the seasons. In the spring, summer, and fall we spend a good amount of time playing outside, like jumping on the trampoline or swinging. In the winter, there is more TV watching, and playing with the dollhouse. It always ends with read time though, which is about a 30 minute routine that helps the children wind down and obviously involves reading and being read to.

### Learning 9PM-12AM

Then studying occurs. After the children are asleep at roughly 9, I start homework. Which usually last until 11:30 to 12, but may span to 1 if in a time crunch on something. This is the portion of the day where I focus on my learning. Between semesters I use this time to work on personal projects that I haven’t fit in throughout the days of class. I am currently working on my Bachelors in IT with a concentration in Software Engineering. It would be a degree in Computer Science if I could find any college in the state other than Georgia Tech that has a Computer Science program that is fully online. This is when I focus on myself and my personal development, which I think is important to being a well rounded person. At this point I intend this time to be spent on a Masters in Computer Science after I complete the Bachelors.

## Sleep 12AM-7AM Maybe

Then what remains is sleep. This may be 12-6 or 11:30-7:30 depending on what is needed the following day. At this point in time I still wake up with an infant every other night, I at least wake up once every night though. I do wish I slept more, but realistically I need to squeeze every minute out of the day as I can. No rest for the wicked, am I right?
