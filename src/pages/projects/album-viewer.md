This is a desktop application built in java for creating and viewing photo albums. It allows you to compile a list of pictures in any format and saves out to a photo album file (paf) that
can be opened again next time you run the app. It also has the ability to scroll through the album at whatever rate you desire, or you can manually flip through. I also added a filter selection
which will apply a color overlay to the imageview.
