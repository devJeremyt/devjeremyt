This is a Home Media Center app built with NodeJS, Express, ffmpeg, and MongoDB. The purpose is simply for offline viewing of video content within a home.
Once setup and running from a server or computer, any device with a browser on the same network as the server can stream locally. The user just creates a folder for each
row/category and adds the mp4s to the directory. For more information on the setup see the readme <a href="https://github.com/devJeremyt/MediaCenter" target="_blank">https://github.com/devJeremyt/MediaCenter</a>.
